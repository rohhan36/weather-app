# weather-app
The weather app shows current weather conditions based on a search of city names.

I made this app using HTML, CSS & JS. I also have used APIs from OpenWeather and CountriesNow to get the data of weather and the cities.
You also get suggestions as you type the name of city and also get different pictures according the weather condition and the hour of the day.
